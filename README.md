Had to create 2 python files one for weather and the other for vacation.

Vacation python:
Create a map that displays a point for every city in the city_data_df DataFrame. The size of the point should be the humidity in each city
Narrow down the city_data_df DataFrame to find your ideal weather condition
Create a new DataFrame called hotel_df
For each city, use the Geoapify API to find the first hotel located within 10,000 metres of your coordinates
Add the hotel name and the country as additional information in the hover message for each city in the map
Export to html

Weather python:
Create Plots to Showcase the Relationship Between Weather Variables and Latitude
Latitude Vs. Temperature
Latitude Vs. Humidity
Latitude Vs. Cloudiness
Latitude vs. Wind Speed Plot
Linear Regression for Each Relationship
Temperature vs. Latitude Linear Regression Plot
